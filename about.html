      <section id="about">
        <h2>This game is all about teaching young kids about the process of voting! </h2>
        <p>
            Now more than ever, it's important for everyone to vote. Young people, who are a
            historically under-represented group when it comes to voting, should be informed at
            a young age about the voting process. That's exactly what this game is for!
        </p>
        <p> This game was made in 24 hours by Tyler Wong, Caroline Johnson, 
            Jonathan Beaubien, and Nora Morsi for Dubhacks 2020, made with 
            emotional support from Nick Roberts and Zahra McKee.
