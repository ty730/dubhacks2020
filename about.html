        <h3>This game is all about teaching young kids about the process of voting! </h3>
        <p>
            We believe in the importance of having a voice in your government, and
            since young people are a repeatedly hard group to get out to vote, our
            team thought creating a game targetting young children that would teach them
            the importance of the voting process.
        </p>
        <p> This game was made in 24 hours by Tyler Wong, Caroline Johnson, 
            Jonathan Beaubien, and Nora Morsi for Dubhacks 2020, made with 
            emotional support from Nick Roberts and Zahra McKee.
