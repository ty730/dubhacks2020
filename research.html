          Hello! My name is Kim Kimberly and I am running for President of the United States.
          I proudly believe that our water fountains within our public parks are lack-luster.
          One of my key policies is that for every new water fountain built within this great nation
          we will have at least one lemonade fountain built. I have experience in public service
          including being the Mayor of Seattle where I helped raise money for schools through
          a local income tax. Some of my values include: fairness, creativity, happiness, and leadership.

        <p>
          Hey voters, I’m Marcus Markstrom, and I’m running for President as a member of the
          Purple Party. I’m a big supporter of changing our current week schedules to have
          a three-day weekend every week; Saturday and Sunday are just simply not enough!
          My past position as Superintendent of the Seattle School District showed off my
          leadership skills, where I reformed education to include coding classes at a young age.
          Some of my values include: justice, peace, respect, and creativity.
